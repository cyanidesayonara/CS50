1.  Header file used by bmp.c (which is used by copy.c)
2.  They specify the width of each data type (number = bits) (u = unsigned = non-negative), so the point is standardization. Works on all platforms
3.  1, 4, 4, 2
4.  42 4D (BM in ASCII)
5.  bfSize is the size of the bitmap file. biSize is the number of bytes required by the structure.
6.  It's a top-down DIB. Top left pixel is the first bit in memory.
7.  biBitCount
8.  If user has no permission to read or write, respectively
9.  It means how many blocks (size in bits determined by previous param) fread will read from the file into memory. We only have one block in the file at a time (eg. 0x00)
10. 3
11. It changes the offset of the file pointer, to skip padding when making a copy in this case.
12. SEEK_CUR changes pointer's current location
