0.  a long-ass made-up word
1.  it returns resource usage statistics for selected threads.
2.  16
3.  Passing two large structs by value ie. copying them to a function would take more time and stack space.
4.  The for loop read characters one by one from a file until an EOF character is found. If a character is either a letter or apostrophe (') it gets 
    appended to word. On the other hand if a character is a number or the word gets longer than LENGTH, the current word is consumed and discarded, 
    and index is reset. If neither of the above is true we must be at the end of the word, so a '\0' character is appended. The word is then sent to check().
5.  Using fscan alone would result in every string in the text, including ones with numbers and special characters, being compared to dictionary.
6.  Because LENGTH nd DICTIONARY are #defined constants.
